## Description
This project aims to detect whether a given text was written by a human or generated by an AI model using trained traditional ML models and compare them.
Models used :
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Dataset
I used dataset i found from kaggle, the link below :

Train data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/llm-detect-ai-generated-text-dataset

Consist of 27k+ rows of data

Evaluation data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeyadusf/daigt-all-data-for-competition

Consist of 2.7k rows of data

### Text Preprocessing
Texts are cleaned, and vectorized using TF-IDF.
A custom class Cleaner handles operations like removing HTML tags, normalize punctuations.

### Feature Engineering
- Word and sentence length
- Punctuation and stopwords ratio

### Hyperparameter Tuning 
- Using RandomizedSearchCV

### Evaluation Metrics
Each model is evaluated using:
- Classification report
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-val Accuracy
